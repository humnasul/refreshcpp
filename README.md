# refreshcpp
Refreshing + polishing my C++ skills over Summer 2023 in preparation for Fall 2023!  
Old code from learning C++ throughout high school is included in "old c++ files"  
Practicing over the summer in order to work more efficiently in the school year + gain some new skills :)  
* refreshcpp/old c++ files - contains old files from learning C++ in high school
* refreshcpp/summer 2023 - contains new files of practicing C++ skills throughout the summer!
